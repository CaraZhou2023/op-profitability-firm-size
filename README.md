# Assessing Operating Profitability's Influence on Excess Returns Across Firm Sizes

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a group project that examines the relationship between operating profitability and excess returns across firms of varying sizes. The analysis uses Python for data processing and portfolio construction, and Excel for visualization. 

**Note**: The code shared here reflects the components I personally contributed to as part of the group effort.
